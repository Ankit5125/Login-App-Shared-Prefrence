Shared Preferences allow you to store data that can be retrieved and used anywhere in your application. 

For example, you’ve probably seen the login feature in many apps, right? They often use Shared Preferences in this process. The app sets a flag to `true` so that, by default, the login activity is shown. Once the user successfully logs in, the flag is changed to `false`, so each time the user starts the app, it checks whether they are already logged in.

And that’s how it works!

I hope this helps you understand better.
